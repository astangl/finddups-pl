Simple utility to recursively search one or more specified directories
for duplicate files.

Usage: finddups.pl dir1 [dir2 ... [dirN] ...]

Written originally in 1998 when I was learning Perl, and tweaked over
the years as I learned more. It's 1234 bytes long now, and doesn't seem
to need any more tweaking, so I haven't touched it in a long time.
